  <h1>Points to Ponder</h1>

  <div>
    <span>— Mahatma Gandhi —</span>
    <p>A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span>— Albert Einstein —</span>
    <p>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Henry L. Doherty —</span>
    <p>Be a student as long as you still have something to learn, and this will mean all your life.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— H. Jackson Brown Jr. —</span>
    <p>Don’t say you don’t have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that
were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas
Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Nelson Mandela —</span>
    <p>Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— B. F. Skinner —</span>
    <p>Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Will Rogers —</span>
    <p>Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Nora Roberts —</span>
    <p>If you don’t go after what you want, you’ll never have it. If you don’t ask, the answer is always
no. If you don’t step forward, you’re always in the same place.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Vincent Van Gogh —</span>
    <p>If you hear a voice within you say ‘you cannot paint,’ then by all means paint, and that voice will
be silenced.</p>
  </div>

	<div>
    <span>— Albert Einstein —</span>
    <p>Imagination is more important than knowledge.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe —</span>
    <p>Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Albert Einstein —</span>
    <p>Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Mahatma Gandhi —</span>
    <p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe —</span>
    <p>None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believed they are free.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Thomas A. Edison —</span>
    <p>Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just
one more time.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <span>— Mother Teresa —</span>
    <p>Peace begins with a smile.. Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that
person, a beautiful thing.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Pope John Paul II —</span>
    <p>The future starts today, not tomorrow.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Lao Tzu —</span>
    <p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Abraham Lincoln —</span>
    <p>The best way to predict your future is to create it.</p>
  </div>

<div>
    <span>— Michael Altshuler —</span>
    <p>The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot.</p>
